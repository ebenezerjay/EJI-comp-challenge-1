<h1>Intro<h1>

<p>
This site is a replication of a static site that was given to us, to model after. Our creative license included images, copy, icons, and the color palette. We were not allowed to change the layout. 
</p>
<h1>What i did</h1>
<p>
	In the header I swapped out the text and icons for my own. The body has one section, which has all of the mini sections (cards). I used the display flex property to make the columns and to align certain items. I added media queries to make a couple elements responive at the first breakpoint (width 1095px). 
</p>
<h1>What i didn't do</h1>
<p>
	A lot. In an attempt to make the css more DRY i tried to style all of my h4 tags at once. This posed problems with the font color and the different background colors. The site is not very responsive.
</p>
<h1>How i can do better</h1>
<p>
	Give myself more time! Make classes for each heading tag instead of having them all be styled the same. Basically i need to do better planning of my layout.
